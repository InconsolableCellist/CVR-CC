# CVR-CC: ChilloutVR Closed Captions for movie worlds

## What is CVR-CC?

CVR-CC hooks into CVRVideoPlayers in [ChilloutVR](https://abinteractive.net) to provide closed captions for movies.
When a movie is loaded it reads the URL, attempts to extract the movie name, and queries the CVR-CC backend AWS service
to request an SRT for that movie. In most cases, resonably named movies will result in the SRT being returned.
The SRT is then parsed and synced to the CVRVideoPlayer, displaying the subtitles on the HUD.

## Requirements

- [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader.Installer) or [CVRMelonAssistant](https://github.com/knah/CVRMelonAssistant/) (automated install) for ChilloutVR 
    - Refer to the [CVR Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/xE7AwSrn) for installation help

## Installation

1. Copy the `CVR_CC.dll` into your ChilloutVR Mods folder (e.g., `C:\Steam\steamapps\common\ChilloutVR\Mods\CVR_CC.dll`).
2. Join a world with a video player in desktop or VR mode
3. Load a movie (paste a URL or have someone select one)

If the movie is found, you should see subtitles appear in yellow text on the bottom of your HUD.

## Troubleshooting

If subtitles fail to load, refer to your MelonLoader logs/window to see error messages. Most likely, the URL doesn't contain the movie name.
If necessary, submit an issue on Github and include all relevant log output. 

## Future Improvements

- Add support for multiple languages
- Implement a UI for changing the offset for subtitles that are running fast/slow
- Implement a UI for searching for a movie when the search fails
